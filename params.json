I've never done this before, so I decided to just write a little blurb about myself.\r\n\r\nI graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor's of Science, majoring in Computer Science: Software Engineering. I've currently work at [Safe Software](www.safe.com/about) in the city of Surrey. Surrey is a suburb of Vancouver and it's about 20-25 minute drive from the YVR airport.\r\n\r\n### More About Me\r\n+ [Facebook](www.facebook.com/jhuynh64)\r\n+ [Twitter](www.twitter.com/jhuynh64)\r\n+ [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jhuynh64)\r\n+ [GitHub](@jhuynh64)\r\n+ [Email](jackiehuynh64@gmail.com)\r\n",
